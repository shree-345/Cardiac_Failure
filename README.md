Technical Challenges faced;

Before we use crosstab(), we need to enable the tablefunc extension. Run the following command in pgAdmin to enable it in our database CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc
To get a PIE chart in output run the query in PASQL tool not in Qyery tool
Understanding the dataset, columns, medical terminology, and the relationship    between tables
Creating triggers, stored procedures, and functions was challenging for us
Because of the time constraint, we could not give much emphasis on the query optimization part
To have a basic understanding of the topic before writing a query, for example, to work on statistical functions like RANDOM_NORMAL, PERCENTILE_CONT, and STDDEV_SAMP, I needed to go through many statistical topics.
We have tried to use complex function like First_value, Execute format,Nth Value, NTILE, CUME_DIST
