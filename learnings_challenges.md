Technical Challenges We have faced;

1.	Before we use crosstab(), we need to enable the tablefunc extension. Run the following command in pgAdmin to enable it in our database
             CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc
2.	  To get a PIE chart in output run the query in PASQL tool not in Qyery tool 
3.	   Understanding the dataset, columns, medical terminology, and the relationship    between tables
4.	  Creating triggers, stored procedures, and functions was challenging for us
5.	  Because of the time constraint, we could not give much emphasis on the query optimization part
6.	 To have a basic understanding of the topic before writing a query, for example, to work on statistical functions like RANDOM_NORMAL, PERCENTILE_CONT, and STDDEV_SAMP, I needed to go through many statistical topics.
7.	We have tried to use complex function like First_value, Execute  format,Nth Value, NTILE, CUME_DIST
